This folder contains an implementation of the CHiMaD Phase Field benchmark "problem 4" Elastic Precipitate problem using MEMPHIS.

This benchmark problem looks into into (a) a coherent precipitate elastically stressed if a lattice parameter is mismatched between the matrix and precipitate phases, or (b) a volumetric elastic stresses arise for an incoherent precipitate due to thermal expansion mismatch with the matrix.
Parametrization and simulation conditions are described at https://pages.nist.gov/pfhub/benchmarks/benchmark4.ipynb/
