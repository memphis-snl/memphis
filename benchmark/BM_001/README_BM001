This folder contains an implementation of the CHiMaD Phase Field benchmark "problem 1" Spinodal Decomposition problem using MEMPHIS.

This benchmark problem looks into the classical spinodal decomposition microstructure evolution problem.
Two benchmark problems are tested here. They correspond to a square computational domain with side length of 200 units (dimensionless).
In one case, periodic boundary conditions are applied to a square domain (problem 1(a)), while. in the other case, no-flux boundaries are applied to a square domain (problem 1(b)).

Parametrization and simulation conditions are described at https://pages.nist.gov/pfhub/benchmarks/benchmark1.ipynb/
