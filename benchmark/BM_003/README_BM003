This folder contains an implementation of the CHiMaD Phase Field benchmark "problem 3" Dendritic Growth problem using MEMPHIS.

This benchmark problem looks into dendritic growth simulations.
Parametrization and simulation conditions are described at https://pages.nist.gov/pfhub/benchmarks/benchmark3.ipynb/
